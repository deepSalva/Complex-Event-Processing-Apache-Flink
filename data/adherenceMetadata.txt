            It's calculated from the past 7 days, excluding the current day.
            The unit should be in percentage.
            The calculation should take place by "weighting" the medication based on the active ingredients.
            The weighting of the drugs should be done taking care of the ones included in the pdf, which are twice as impactful as the others
